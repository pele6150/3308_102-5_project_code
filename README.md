Welcome to our project, Short Fuze! Short Fuze is a 2D platformer-type game where Short Fuze, our main character, is tasked with collecting as many coins as possible within a given time period. These coins are scattered throughout a level which consists of various platforms, so the challenge is to traverse this environment as efficiently as possible while also collecting as many coins as possible. Once the player’s time has run out, the game ends and the player’s score is automatically registered in a database and displayed on a scoreboard, which records and outputs the scores of all players over time. The scoreboard also displays the max number of coins collected by that player in a single game, the total number of coins collected, and the total number of games they’ve played. This allows players to compete against each other or with themselves.
